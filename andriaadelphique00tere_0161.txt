NOTES. 155

22. 15. Aliquid monstri. Some commentators
think these words refer to some plot which was in

agitation. Donatus interprets them as referring to
the woman.

23. 19. Forum. In this, as in most other passages
of Terence, this word signifies a -marlcet-place.

23. 26. Hujus ,· Glycery. Μῳίἱαναηις with Phil-
umena. Patris pudor: “reverence sor my father?

23. 30. Advorsum hun03 for huic5 referring to
Pamphilus.

24. 33. Laborat e dolore ,- meaning probably that
she is in labor, as Mysis afterwards speaks of going
for a midwife.

26. 1. Quid ais, Byrrhia? We have seen, in a
former scene, that Davus went to the sorum in
search of Pamphilus, to tell what had passed be-
tween him and the old man. He there met Byr-
rhia, and informed him of the intended marriage.
Charinus, who was in love with Philumena, hearing
this from Byrrhia‚ gives rise to the conversation in
this scene.

26. 9. Facile . . . . sentias. A passage similar
to this occurs in Shakspeare z —-

“ Men

Can counsel, and speak comfort to that grief,
Which they themselves not feel 3 but, tasting it,

Their counsel turns to passion.⁷⁷
