In addition to the above, the series will probably contain a volume
of Pliny, one of Lucretius, and six of Cicero.

The following are selected from many notices of this series which
have appeared :—

From the North American Review.

⁸‘ The lovers ‘of Latin are under obligations to ΜΓ. Dillaway sor his
very neat and cominodious editions of Cicero. Many will be tempted
>to read these pretty volumes who might ‘not seel courage enough to un-
dertake the task of perusing a less convenient edition 3 and many will
purchase these interesting treatises‚ as they appear separately and at a
moderate price, who would have been repelled by tlie labor and expense
of goingthrough the ‘ Opera omnia.’ The form much resenibles that
of the Regent’s edition, being very neat, and printed with remarkable
correctness ..... We trust that Mr. Dillaway will continue his labors
in this maoch, feeling sure that, isne goes on as he has magun, he will
render good service to the cause of the classics in our country.”

From the Christian Ezaminer.

“ These volumes may be numbered among the best specimens which
have come under our notice, of what school editions of the classice
oughtto be. The generally received textos Olivet and Ernesti has been
adopted iu both cases ..... The Notes, which make about a third of

each volume, are drawn up with much care,judgment‚ and taste.”
