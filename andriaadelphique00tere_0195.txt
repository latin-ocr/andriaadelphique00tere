From the Christian Ezaminer.

“ These volumes may be numbered among the best specimens which
have come under our notice, of what school editi0us of the classics
ought to be. The generally received text of Olivet and Ernesti has been
adopted in both cases ..... The NoteS, which make anout a third of
each volume, are drawn up With much care,judgrneut, and taste 3 their
design being to explain allusions, resolve unusual and blind construo
tionS, and pouit out nice shades of meaning, without interfer'ng, how-
ever, with the province of the lexicographer, or involving the student
in philol‹›gic.1l questions sor which heis not prepared, or drawing away
his attention to irrelevant topics. The appearance os the page is also
fair aud inviting, and the mechanical execution in all respects satisfac-
tory3 and yet the whole is afforded at a price considerably less than was
pald, not many years agO, for the coarse and dingy class-books then
used in our academies and colleges.

“The two volumes before ue, we observe, are printed and bound so
as to match, and we understand it is Mr. Dillaway’s purpose to add to
the series—a purpose which we hope he will find opportunity and

encouragement to realize.”

From tlte Biblical Repository.

“ The latter of these works (De Officiis) has long been studied in
most of the colleges and higher seminaries of New England. The
treatises contained in the other, (De Senectute et de Amicitia,) though
hardly less valuable, have not, we believe, been so generally used as
text-books, but are much read in private. Mr. Dillaway has done a
good service to the cause of classical learning, and of good taste and
sound morals, in giving these editions to the public. They are fairly
adapted to the study of youth by the excellence of their style and the
purity of their sentiments. Ayoung man can hardly rise from the
perusal of them, without feeling a certain elevation of thought, and
strengthening of virtuous purposes3 while, as specimens of pure lan-
guage and fair writing, they cannot be too carefully stndied .....
The editor has well done what he has undertaken to do. The Notes
are accurate, in good taste, and well illustrate the text.'’

‘⁴ Ι have read over the volume, (De Senectute et de Amicitia) aud it
appears to me to be edited with great care and good judgment. The
typography is uncommonly neat and correct.”

“ I received from you, some time agn, your edition of Cicero de Se-
nectute and De Officiis. I shall probably introduce them into this

College at the next session.’'

From a Letter of Rev. Wilburvf'isk, 't‘ D., Presidenc of tlte Wesleyan
nivers-z .

. . . . “I am highly pleased with ,gout neat edition of Cicero de

Oratore ...... The editorial and mechanical execution will, 1

think, recommend the work to the public.”
