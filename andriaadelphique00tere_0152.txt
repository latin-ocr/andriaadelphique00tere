being so few 111 pompous tragica] recitals3 however,
from observation we learn the chief elisions, poetlc
licenseS, δια, adopted by Terence, which are as fol-
low: —-

He very frequently rejects s, as, agi', for agis,· u,
as, discip’li, for discipuli ,- sec’lum, for seculum ,- pe·
ric’li‚ for periculi ,· v, 35, diitias, or ditias, for divitias ,-
also d before a vowel, as, qui’istuc, for quid istuc .· is
3 verse commences with a vowel, and the preceding
ends with a vowel, the latter is elided: final vowels
before other vowels are sometimes not elided; this,
as well as his doubling consonantS, as, redducere,
for reducere, are chiefly to be accounted for by the
arsis

He contracts, by synaeresis, into one syllable, meum,
deum, tuus, puer, rei, eho, suit, &c.; into two syl-
lableS, eodem, duorum, διο. &c.

He, on the other hand, dissolves, by diaereffls, Jam
into two syllables, vero into three, vaginem mto
four, &Q

The best general rule which can be given for the
elisions, &c., is to measure the lines as they would
be read. This single principle, properly applied,
would do away with a great many ill-founded con-
jectures, by which the lines are adapted to the metre
and not the metre to the lines.
