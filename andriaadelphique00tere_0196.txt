Exti-act from a Letaer of Rev. Justin Edwards, D. D.‚ President offindover
Theological Seminary.

. . . . ‘⁶ The execution of the work is such as does great credit to the
editor and the printers.”

From Rev. Francis Wayland, D. D.‚ President ofBrown University.

‘⁵ I rejoice to perceive that your efforts are continued in this most
important tield of litei-ary labor. Few works need judicious notes
ruore than this one, (Cicero de Oratore 3) and for want of them and in
consequence of the very inferior editions which have been published
in this country heretofore, I believe it has been read much less than it
deserves. l have no doubt that it will supersede all the other forms in
which this treatise has been presented to the public, and Ι shall feel it
my duty to recommend it whenever it may be in my power.”

· From tlze Λητωίς ofEducation. By Prof. E. A. Andrews.

“ Among the philosophical writings of Cicero, there are probably
none so generally read, or so justly admired, as his treatises on Old Age
and Friendship5 and it is remarkable that, until the present time, no
good edition of these works has issued from the American press. The
only distinct edition of these essays which has been published for many
years in England, so far as we are informed, is that of Ε. Η. Barker,
which, though abounding, like the other works of the same editor, in
evidences of extensive research and profound scholarship‚ is not well
adapted to the use of the common classical student. It is therefore
with peculiar satisfaction that we welcome this edition, enriched as it
is by the editorial labors of Mr. Dillaway.’'

From the Christian Register.

“ We have given to the present work (De Senectute et de Amicitia)
some examination‚ and cannot refrain from expressing high approba-
tion of the manner in which the editor has performed his important
task. The most difficult part of his labor was the preparation of the
Notes. This he has executed with great ¹skill‚ accuracy, and judgment.
. . . . ΜΓ. Dillaway is particularly well fitted for the work he has
undertaken, having had ample experience as instructor in the first
classica] school in our country.”

From the Christian Review.

“This is a very neat edition of Cicero’s treatise De Officiis. The
text is printed in a clear, handsome type, leaded, and so divided into
sections and marked with figures along the margin, as to make the
book convenient for recitatione. The English notes of the editor
appear to be correct and judicious, affor-<ling Just the kind of aid which
the students· need, without encuiubering them with help. The same
editor has published similar editions of Cicero’s book De Oratore, and
of the beautiful little essays De Senectute et de Amicitia ..... These
books are evidences osa widely-spread taste for classica! learning, and
they are well adapted to foster it. Believing that ajudicious study of
the elassies is a valunble means of mental discipline, and is capable,
under the directior) os a wise tencher, of being made an instrument of
moral instruction, we look with pleasure on every indication osa
growing love sor the study.”
